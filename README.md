# cfs: isolated Cloud Foundry CLI contexts

Run multiple Cloud Foundry CLI sessions and targets in parallel without
`CF_HOME` conflicts.

The official `cf` CLI keeps its active API, organization, space, and
authentication state in `$HOME/.cf`, so changing the target in one terminal
changes it everywhere. `cfs` gives each project or Git worktree an isolated
`CF_HOME` while preserving the normal `cf` command. Optional named contexts let
one project use several targets without a shared current selection.

## Quick start

Install the [official CF CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli), then install
`cfs` with Go 1.26.8+:

```sh
go install github.com/zongqichen/cloud-foundry-cli-contexts/cmd/cfs@latest
cfs setup
```

Prebuilt binaries support Linux and macOS on x86-64 and arm64. Put the shim
directory printed by `cfs setup` first on `PATH`, open a new shell, and run
`cfs doctor`.

Now log in normally from each project:

```sh
cd ~/work/orders
cf login --sso -a https://api.example.com -o commerce -s development
cf apps
```

Another project or Git worktree receives a separate context automatically.
Terminals and agents in the same worktree intentionally share its default
context.

## Updating

Check for a newer published release without changing the installed binary:

```sh
cfs update
```

For scripts and coding agents, use `cfs update --json`. When an update is
available, follow the printed command or update through the same installation
channel. A Go installation can be updated with:

```sh
go install github.com/zongqichen/cloud-foundry-cli-contexts/cmd/cfs@latest
cfs setup
cfs doctor
```

Successful interactive `cfs` control commands check at most once every 24 hours
and show one notice per new version. Checks never run from the transparent `cf`
shim, JSON output, CI, or non-interactive processes. Set
`CFS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable notices. Version checks contact only the public
GitHub Releases API and send no Cloud Foundry or workspace data.

## Multiple targets in one project

The normal `cf` command always uses the workspace's `default` context. Create a
named context only when the same workspace needs another independent target:

```sh
cfs context create prod
cfs -c prod login --sso -a https://api.example.com -o commerce -s production
cfs -c prod apps
```

Each name has its own `CF_HOME` and lock. Names are workspace-local and selected
per command; there is no mutable current context to race over. Inspect them
with `cfs context list` or `cfs context status prod --json --redact`. Unknown
names fail without creating state.

## Existing login

To copy your current global CF target into a workspace once:

```sh
cd ~/work/orders
CFS_DISABLE=1 cf target
cfs import
```

To import into a named context instead:

```sh
cfs context create prod
cfs import --context prod
```

The import is a private snapshot, not a link. It may contain active credentials.
Use `cfs import --yes` in non-interactive automation and `--force` only when you
intend to replace an existing workspace target. `cfs` never imports credentials
silently.

## Coding agents

No agent integration is required. Start Codex, Claude Code, or an IDE agent in
its project or worktree and let it run ordinary `cf` commands. Give an agent an
exact named command such as `cfs -c prod apps` when it needs a non-default
target. To pin the workspace regardless of the agent's working directory, set
`CFS_WORKSPACE_ROOT`; to run one command against the global target, use `cfs
global <cf ...>`. For diagnostics safe to attach to agent logs, use:

```sh
cfs describe --json
cfs status --json --redact
cfs context status prod --json --redact
```

`cfs describe --json` is the one-call self-discovery surface: version, exit-code
contract, environment variables, workspace resolution, and the contexts in the
current workspace. It never invokes `cf`. The state-changing commands
(`cfs context create` / `remove`, `cfs import`, `cfs reset`) also accept `--json`
and print a structured result for the agent to parse.

The optional [cfs Agent Skill](.agents/skills/cfs/SKILL.md) teaches agents to
discover existing contexts, fail closed on ambiguity, and preserve user
authorization. Install it for Codex, Claude Code, or another supported agent:

```sh
npx skills add zongqichen/cloud-foundry-cli-contexts --skill cfs
```

To make invocation explicit, add `Use $cfs for Cloud Foundry context
selection.` to `AGENTS.md`, or `Use /cfs for Cloud Foundry context selection.`
to `CLAUDE.md`.

## How it works

```text
cf command      -> cfs shim -> workspace default CF_HOME -> official cf CLI
cfs -c NAME ... -> cfs      -> workspace named CF_HOME   -> official cf CLI
```

`cfs setup` places a transparent `cf` shim on `PATH`. For each invocation, the
shim resolves the current workspace, selects its private state, and delegates to
the official CLI. Named commands take the same path with an explicit context.
Authentication, token refresh, plugins, API calls, signals, and exit codes
remain the official CLI's responsibility.

Git worktrees are detected automatically. For a directory that is not a Git
worktree, create this marker at its root:

```toml
version = 1
```

Alternatively, select a workspace for one command:

```sh
CFS_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/workspace cf apps
```

## Commands

```text
cfs setup           Install the transparent cf shim
cfs status          Show the current workspace and target
cfs describe        Print the cfs contract (version, exit codes, env, contexts)
cfs context         Create, list, inspect, or remove named contexts
cfs global          Run one cf command against the global target
cfs import          Import the global context into default or a named context
cfs doctor          Diagnose the installation and workspace
cfs reset           Move this workspace's state to trash
cfs gc              Find stale workspace state
cfs uninstall       Remove the shim without deleting state
cfs version         Print version information
cfs update          Check for a newer published release
cfs help [command]  Show help
```

Run `cfs help context` for the named-context commands.

Entered the wrong workspace, or need to log in somewhere else for a moment?
Run one command against the global target without leaving the directory:

```sh
cfs global login --sso
cfs global target
```

This is the discoverable form of `CFS_DISABLE=1 cf ...`. `cfs` collects no
telemetry. Workspace state and recoverable trash can contain active tokens; see
[Security](SECURITY.md).
